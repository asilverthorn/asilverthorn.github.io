I'm here again...
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, here I come again with another "thing", I guess.

Different to the other things I've spent too many hours of my life, the attempt here is to make a game I like some 
personal fine-tuning in order to make it a smoother, a bit more balanced experience by making some changes and 
"upgrades" (although, of course, that's more my personal opinion than a fact), and then maybe share it for others to 
enjoy as an extra, seeing how some people actually found my other OCD projects worth their time (for which I'm happy).

In any case, Breath of Fire II was always a curious game to me. It had many things that I saw interesting, but I also 
found a lot of things that kinda bring down the experience that this game offers. Overall it's one of those pretty decent
Super Nintendo titles that some people remember fondly, but also it had some flaws pointed by others,

One of the biggest, was the translation. For some reason, Capcom decided that they wouldn't waste much money, time, or
both, in order to translate this game (An RPG, which is often one of the most important genres as far as text goes);
and what we got was pretty damn bad, to the point of hurting the game not only playable-wise, but also story-wise.

Thankfully, there's a good alternative, the Retranslation made by D4S and Ryusui. It does a much, much better job
at being... Well, intelligible text, for starters.

The other main complain people got about this game was it is quite grindy. Characters need a lot of experiencie,
but monsters give very little (And little money too). This one of the very few changes that the GBA port got,
although in my humble opinion the growth in money and experience is too high to the point of making the game boring,
as you'll be always at a higher level that you're supposed to be, even if you don't grind.

That said; I actually made a small hack that multiplied the Exp and Zenny from the Super Nintendo original some time
ago, but it was rejected, seen as a "cheat hack", and supposedly those were not permitted (Even if they exist on RHDN).

Even if at first I was kinda annoyed by it, I thought, "What the hell, let's try do something else...", and, well,
here's what that waste of time has transformed into! Thank god I resisted doing something actually productive, that 
would have been horrible...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patch A and Patch B
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's right, There are two patches, with one single difference:

What spells Ryu is able to learn through leveling up. Sorry for the next few paragraphs but I want to explain it.

Here's the thing: I don't want to change the Dragon Spells. They're powerful one-time attacks that take all the AP
from Ryu and they're only really powerful when his AP is full, but when they hit they hit HARD. It's an okay gimmick, 
and a classic feature of this title, but, to me, this causes two things:

1: Makes Ryu a boring "mash A button for Attack" type of character, which it's something I never liked in any RPG. 
Using spells is, in most situations out of the question because AP should be reserved to the Dragon Attacks, and even
then, he learns very little besides what you can teach him via NPCs.

2: Makes bosses too easy for the most part. When you can knock off half or a third of a boss' HP in one move, strategies 
kinda become less important. And can be abused very easily if you happen to abuse the cooking system too. Some guides' 
advice for bosses is just to keep using them... I mean, it's a legitimate way to play, I just don't find it very fun.

...Because I make these hacks for me in the first place, I wanted to make Ryu a far more versatile character, by giving
him an actual spell list with a bit of everything. He's the son of a powerful magician, after all, we see it 5 minutes into
the game, even. This way I could play ignoring the Dragon Powers (Which make the game a bit more challenging, and entertaining 
in it's own way) but still being able to do stuff besides attack, round after round, fight after fight, for dozens of hours...

But, I also know some people would like him to stay the same. Heck, I know people that get annoyed because they have to push
Down on the spell list more times than they would like to choose the latest Dragon Power whenever Ryu learnt something new...

So there's when the idea of a second patch came to my mind.

If you want a Ryu that learns a good amount of spells alongside his Dragon powers for veratility and variety, use Patch A.
If you want a simpler Ryu and keep using him just as you always used him besides a couple new utility spells, just use patch B.

There are NO other differences besides this between Patch A and B!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2 - Instructions
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, just like most patches, they're easy to install. First you need a clean Breath of Fire II backup, that matches this
version:

Breath of Fire II (USA).sfc

CRC-32: 67CDACC5
MD-5  : E1FF1ED4AD5DBDBE86774920DFB5E9D4
SHA-1 : 1F7707E606B7E9FA8FB3908BBDDFCB5DEA93D776

This is for an unheadered ROM.

Once you have it, you need to choose between Patch A and Patch B. Read above.

After that you just need to use a tool like LunarIPS to apply the patch you want to the ROM and there you go, patched game!

------------------------------------------------------------------
... THAT IS, IF YOU WANT TO PLAY IT WITH THE ORIGINAL TRANSLATION!
------------------------------------------------------------------


I wouldn't even share this hack if it wasn't compatible with the Retranslation, as I figured that probably most people would 
rather play with text they can understand. Although who can resist "Equip Lod", "Egg beater", and all that engrish?

Anyway...
If you want to combine this with Ryusui's Retranslation, you can! But you need to follow a few steps to make everything work!

1, Get your clean ROM. The dump I used for this hack works also with the Retranslation, so don't worry.

2, Apply the Retranslation on your ROM.

3, IMPORTANT! Boot your newly retranslated ROM. It will make a check to see if everything is right. We need to do this,
   because if the check finds something it doesn't expect, you won't be able to play, and if you applied this hack before
   letting the Retranslation check itself, it would give you an error. Just let it look what it needs, and once it is finished,
   it will create an SRM file (Save RAM file) with a positive check, which will be the only real important part.  
   I'm sorry if isn't as convenient as you (and I) would like to, but I can't do anything about it as it's other person's work.

4, Apply the Retranslation version of this hack (located in it's own folder) over the Retranslated ROM with your usual IPS tool.

And that's pretty much it. After doing that and having the SRM file you can start playing! 
You can also apply the Retranslation alternate intros if you feel like it after all this, both seem to work fine.

3 - Overall Description
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

...Well, similar to other hacks I made, there are a bunch of changes here and there. While this is smaller compared to my other things,
 as the main idea is different from my other hacks, there still quite a few things to say:

Characters have been suffered changes, some big, others are minor adjustements, in order to attempt to give a better balance to the 
roster so there are no "bad/useless" characters. Stats, spells and equipment have been modified for this. The idea, just like in the
original game, is to reach the bulk of their total stats at level 50. 

Equipment had their stats and price changed here and there to compliment the changes made to the characters, and to make each new
weapon you come across a decent upgrade. Some pieces of defensive equipment had their Def/Weight changed, and the characters able to
use them too, this last change will make Rand be able to use a bit more stuff. Prices have been decreased or increased depending on
what each piece of equipment offers in comparison to others (That is to say, a weaker sword should not be more expensive than a 
more powerful one, unless it had a very special secondary effect, for example).

Some consumable items also had their prices changed. Status-healing items are cheaper, for example, and fishes and Meat items got
their prices increased to turn them into a good way to make some money throughout the game without the need of grinding or abusing
the Cooking system.

Spells have received some changes too. AP consumption for most of them is different, and for offensive spells, damage has also
been modified. Now they're a bit more powerful and consistent as far as AP>Damage ratio is concerned, and you can use Magic more
often thanks to the less restricting AP costs. You can find a table with the changes in it's own part of the readme. 

There were changes made to Experience and Zenny too to make the game flow better, with less grinding, both by increasing the 
experience points and Zenny you get, and by changing the Experiencie Tables of the characters.

The Shaman System also got changes. While the combinations stay the same, the bonuses they give may have suffered modifications 
here and there, while the tranformations instead of being plain stat-upgrades attempt to give the character a different role, or
make a certain character a more extreme version of itself (For example, Katt becoming more of a physical crystal cannon).
Oh, and Seny actually does something on her own now!

Because of all these changes, monsters had their stats adjusted. The difficulty level shouldn't be too different, because even if 
enemies are stronger, your characters are all around a better group too. Also note that this hack can be played without even using
Shamans, so they're not necessary at all.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4 - Character Changes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One thing that I always wanted to do to this game is make the least useful characters better, although I ended making changes to
every character in the end, some bigger, some smaller. 

In this section you'll have A LOT of information about each character, and I tried to put it all together in a small space, so is
easy to see all their info quick enough.

Besides the changes you'll see here, there are three others I would like to comment:

1; They way the characters gain stats through level ups has changed. In the original game, they gained stats in a very strange way,
   sometimes getting very little gains, sometimes getting big jumps. That made leveling up less rewarding unless you grinded several
   levels.
 
   Now, characters grow in a much more steady way, making each level up matter a bit more by itself, until level 50. After that,
   characters gain very little stats, just like in the original game. That said, you don't need to go to such level to beat the game.

2; The Experience tables have been modified. In the original game, some characters grew in levels MUCH faster than others, and if you
   had a not so useful character leveling slowly, it could become rather tedious. Not only that, but because Ryu is always on the 
   team, he always ended many levels ahead of everyone else.

   In this hack, between levels 20 and 50, the experience needed to level up has been modified in 3 groups:

   1 - Ryu. He levels up slower than in the original game, but that's not much of a problem because he's always getting exp. He will
       end getting a few levels ahead because of it, but it won't be to the extent of the original game.

   2 - Katt/Bow. These two level up a bit faster than the other characters. This is because there are points where you lose control
       of them, and having to train them up for the time they were away is not that fun. Also, Bow needs less experience from levels
       8-16 so he catches up sooner once you get him hack (If you wish, use the Trout scene to get some Exp!).

   3 - Everyone else. All the other characters take less than before to level up, which means less time grinding, and an easier time
       to manage all characters so they're in similar levels, making the game have a better flow.



3: The Shaman system got some changes, and all the bonuses are wrote down in each character section. The change I want to comment on
   is that Transformations are no longer a plain stat boost. Now they have good and bad points, becoming less of a simple upgrade and
   more of a change to their role, or becoming a more extreme version of a character. This way the original forms keep their importance
   and usefulness.

   For example Jean becoming a stronger and faster character with a strong ability, at the cost of being a lot more fragile and much
   worse at casting and supporting, or Rand becoming even slower but also more physically powerful.

   Oh, and by the way, sorry if the names for transformations aren't the correct ones. I don't know if they have official names...

   Note: When you transform into a character that has less AP; you'll see that your Actual AP is still the same as it was before 
         transforming: Do not fool yourself, you don't have all that AP!

         Let's say that you have 140/80 AP after transforming. This means that once you use a spell, you'll lose ALL the extra AP,
	 and you'll go down to 80, no matter what spell you cast. Think about it as a free, single cast.

With all that said, let's get on with the characters!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Ryu:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Starts at Level 1.	   Ryu is the main character of the game. He's a  blue
__________    ___________  haired guy, capable of transforming into different 
|Spells A:\   | Spells B:\ types of dragons! He's a iconic part of the series.				
+-------------+----------|		
|Lv2  Timewarp|L2  TmWarp| In BoFII, this abilty comes in form of spell-like abilities,		
|Lv3  Tornado |L7  Cure 1| which you select during battle, and do damage based on the

|Lv8  Thunder |L12 Exit  | having full AP will do the most damage.
|Lv12 Exit    |L15 Cure 2| 		
|Lv13 Flame   |L16 Warp	 | In this mod, Ryu is a pretty well balanced character, and in
|Lv15 Warp    |		 | case you chose the A patch, he will learn a good variety of 
|Lv17 Cure 2  |     	 | spells throughout the game, which makes forming parties easier,
|Lv20 Drain   |    	 | as Ryu will have a bit of everything (For example, not needing
|Lv24 Typhoon |		 | to kick a member in order to get another with Warp or Exit spells).
|Lv27 Renew X |		 |
|Lv32 Fireball|		 | But if for some reason you don't want those new spells, you can 
|Lv36 Atk-Up  |   	 | choose the patch B, which only has the basic stuff instead of the
|Lv41 Cure 4  |		 | variety in the list of the left. 
|Lv44 Missile |		 |  
+------------------------+ That said, he's not perfect, his AP is not that high, he's not the		
| Special Ability: Guts  | fastest thing alive (and heavy equipment will not help), and he's unable to 
+------------------------+ take advantage of the Shaman's help, but those weak points are kinda minor when 
|Ryu will try to regain  | compared to his strong ones. Ryu is a well rounded and reliable main character.

|Ryu knows how to fish! You'll need a rod and some bait first, and get into a fishing area when you see fish |

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Bow:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Starts at level 1.	   Bow is Ryu's best friend since they were kids, and a humanoid dog.
________		   
|Spells:\		   He's quite charlatan and is much more smooth talking than Ryu, and he ends up in problems   
+-----------------+	   more often than not... But he's a loyal friend, a hard worker and a fun character.
|Lv 2 Cure 1      |	   
|Lv 3 Heal        |	   In this mod he retains his main concept: Being a healer. Although now he has some offensive
|Lv 8 Tornado     |	   spells added to be even more useful. He's also stronger and has some more stamina.
|Lv14 Sonic Boom  |	   
|Lv17 Cure 2      |        It's sad that for a long chunk of the game you can't use him, but thankfully he levels up
|Lv19 Renew       |    	   rather fast, and his supportive spells come in very handy if you want to train him up to 
|Lv23 Def-Up X    |	   get him close to your other characters, which shouldn't take that long.
|Lv25 Cure 3      |        
|Lv28 Typhoon     | 	   The crossbows Bosch can get have some neat special perks, like atacking twice, or even
|Lv32 Renew X     |   	   hitting all enemies at the same time.
|Lv37 Cure 4      |	   
|Lv43 Cure X      |	   His Snipe ability can actually H1KO some of the harder enemies, it's not only usable with
+------------------------+ weak foes (Although, of course, it does not work on bosses).
| Special Ability: Shot  | 
+------------------------+ 
|Bow will try to snipe   |  
|an enemy, killing it in |__________________

+------------------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
|Field ability: Hunt											     |
| 													     |
| Sometimes you'll see a patch of grass moving on the overworld. If you go to it, you'll enter a small area  |
| with animals walking around. Bow can shoot his crossbow and hunt them to get meat or items from them!      |

|      +10% STR 	                      will damage all enemies for moderate damage. 		     |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Rand:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Starts at Level 13.	  Rand is a character you meet in Colossea/Coursair, and part of the named
________		  "Shell Clan", which are humanoid armadillos.
|Spells:\		  
+---------------+	  Rand is, in several ways, like a Monk of a Final Fantasy game. I mean:
|Lv1  Cure 1    |	  
|Lv4  CurePsn   |	  Very high HP, very high physical power, fights with his bare hands,
|Lv14 Sonic Boom| 	  has a limited amount of equipment available, and it consists on light
|Lv16 Cure 2    |	  armor for the most part. But Rand here has some things to offer above that.
|Lv20 Renew     |	  
|Lv23 8.0       |	  Rand possesses a decent spell list, consisting mostly on healing and support
|Lv27 Cure 3    |	  spells which go pretty well alongside his physical capabilities. He also learns
|Lv32 Heal      |     	  Some decent offensive spells, although they are few and far between.
|Lv35 Cure 4    |    	  That said, he has some weak points, he's the slowest character, and his
|Lv41 Atk-Up    |	  limited equipment selection makes him more susceptible to elemental attacks.
+-----------------------+ He's also gone for a chunk of the early game, although for this hack, he starts
| Special Ability: Wake | with a higher level so he doesn't end behind your other characters when he becomes
+-----------------------+ avaiable again.
|Rand will slap an ally | Rand is a fantastic character overall, and can be used in a variety of ways.

+-----------------------+-----------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
|Field ability: Rolling											     |
| 													     |
| Rand curls into a ball and is able to move very fast around the overworld. While you're rolling around, you|
| won't find any random encounters. It's hard to control, and if you run into things you could start a fight.|

+--------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Katt:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joins at Level 8.          Katt is a member of the Woren, which are human-like beings with feline
			   features. She joins the adventure after fighting with her in the Coliseum!
________		   
|Spells:\		   Katt is a very, very phyiscally oriented character. She hits really hard, and
+-------------+		   she's the fastest character which not only makes her skull-bashing abilities more
|Lv10 Flame   |		   useful, but also makes a perfect candidate for desperate item-healing duties.
|Lv18 Fireball|		   In the original game, she had far too little HP for the role she was supposed to have,
|Lv24 Hail    | 	   so in this hack also gets much better HP, and her Stamina also got a boost.
|Lv30 Bolt X  |		   
+------------------------+ On the other hand, she has very limited spell-casting abilities, although ironically
| Special Ability: Taunt | she learns very powerful spells, it's just that she doesn't get much AP to use. But
+------------------------+ her AP also got a small boost so at least she can use them much earlier than in the
| Katt tries to catch the| end-game. Katt is a fun character to have, even more with all the critical hits she does!

+------------------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
|Field ability: Staff Attack										     |
| 													     |
| Katt swings her staff in an attempt to hit whatever is directly in front of her. This ability has different|
| uses, from hunting to breaking certaing things, opening doors or interacting with some objects.            | 
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|Shamans: Transformation: Devil Katt   									     |
|													     |
|Katt transforms into a blue skinned being, with large ears and long blonde hair. This transformations has   |
|different effects depending on the combination, but most of them increase her physical abilities and speed  |
|at the cost of her defense, making her "glass cannon" archetype even more pronounced, while the other       |
|transformation grants her more AP, Strenght and Wisdom at the cost of defense and Speed          |
|Katt can't use her staff outside battle while transformed, which can be annoying...                         |		     
+-------------+											             |

      Nina:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joins at level 10.         Nina is a royal member of the Wing Clan, a race of people with wings
________		   that live in Wyndia. She's reserved and doesn't like to fool around too much.
|Spells:\		   
+--------------+	   In the original game, Nina sadly had several issues. For one, another character
|Lv1  Tornado  |	   completely overshadowed her, with better stats and getting spells sooner than her too.
|Lv1  Spark    |	   
|Lv1  Cold     | 	   Those things have been for the most part rectified. Nina learns many spells, and
|Lv1  Thunder  |	   the most powerful ones she gets much sooner than before. She also had her stats 
|Lv7  Def Down |	   altered; with improvements in most stats. She's now more resistant, faster, and can
|Lv12 S.Boom   |	   hit physically to some extent. Although because the changes in magic you probably 
|Lv13 Exit     |	   should prefer to spend her time casting spells for better damage, at least most of the time.
|Lv14 Pwr Down |     	    
|Lv15 Drain    |    	   Nina has a good list of Shaman combinations, which gives you the ability to customize
|Lv17 Flame    |	   her stats in more ways than other characters.

	Sten:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joins at level 11.	   Sten is a Highlander, a race of immortal beings that come from the planet Zei-wait, 
________		   wrong franchise. Higlanders in BOFII are a tribe of humanoid monkeys from Highfort.
|Spells:\		   
+-------------+		   In the original game Sten was seen as one of the least useful characters (to say it
|Lv1  Spark   |		   softly). He was referenced as a "worse Katt", which is a sad thing to say about a
|Lv12 Flame   |		   character, at least for me.
|Lv15 Hush    | 	   
|Lv16 Drain   |		   In my hack, Sten got some pretty decent upgrades. He's still comparable to Katt, but
|Lv18 Def Down|		   not so much as a "worse versioN" but a different way of doing a similar concept.
|Lv22 Typhoon |		   He's not as strong as Katt (yet he's far stronger than in the original game), and 
|Lv24 Dice *  |		   slightly less fast, but has much better resistance, and far superior casting abilities.
|Lv28 Fireball|     	   
|Lv32 Death   |    	   His AP is only okay, but his Luck is fantastic! His spell list also got bigger, with
|Lv39 Missile |		   more options, being able to silence enemies, make them more susceptible to his physical
+------------------------+ hits, and he even sports the Death spell and a new spell: Dice.
| Special Ability: RIP   | 
+------------------------+ Dice is a stronger version of ChopChop! It takes some AP, but it will come in handy 
| After targeting a foe, | here and there. All in all, Sten should be a better character.

|Field ability: Arm Stretching										     |
| 													     |
| Sten is able to stretch his limbs in order to cross gaps (usually marked with a pole in each side). This is|

	Jean:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joins at level 15.         Jean is an anthropomorphic frog, member of the so called "Creeping Clan", from the 
________		   kingdom of Simafort. He's a carefree and relaxed guy, which gives the idea that he's
|Spells:\		   not very smart, but seeing his comments when talking to him through the game in your
+-------------+		   village, he probably knows a lot more than he lets on. Also speaks french in a world with no France.
|Lv1  Agi-Up  |		   
|Lv16 Freeze  |		   In any case, Jean was another character seen as subpar. Not great stats, which made his
|Lv17 Renew   | 	   special ability kinda useless. Not a great spell list either, and there were better 
|Lv18 Pwr-Down|		   front-line characters. So he was just there for his field ability and Warp, mostly. 
|Lv19 Heal    |		   But that has changed a lot in this hack.
|Lv20 Cure 2  |		   
|Lv21 Def-Up X|		   Jean has become more or less the idea of a"Paladin". His strength is now good, his Stamina 
|Lv23 Shield  |     	   is quite high, making him a very "tanky" character, his AP and spell list are pretty  
|Lv26 Angel   |    	   decent, with a bit of everything, but mostly support spells, and his Luck is still
|Lv29 Hail    |		   the best of the crew. Overall, he's a great guy to have in the front, taking hits from
|Lv33 Cure 4  |            other characters, where he can also deal some physical damage or still use spells.
|Lv39 Cure 3  |		   
+------------------------+ That said, his carefree nature still shows, because he's the second slowest character in
| Special Ability: Jab   | the team. And heavy equipment won't help either. He doesn't have that many offensive spells 
+------------------------+ either, so he may benefit from learning Missile.  On the other hand, thanks to his better  
| Jean will thrust his   | Strength and rapiers, his Jab ability will be much more useful now!

	Spar:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joins at level 18*.    Spar is one of the rare members of the Grassmen race,
________               some sort of plant-people, very long lived and somewhat emotionless.
|Spells:\	       
+-------------+	       Just like Sten and Jean, Spar was also seen by people as a weak character
|Lv1  Cold    |	       that probably was wasting a spot on your team, and to be honest, Spar's
|Lv2  Cure 1  |	       stats were pretty low (not counting HP). But it's a different matter now.
|Lv3  Agi-Dwn |        
|Lv4  Pwr-Dwn |	       While Spar has lost HP compared to the original game, the other stats have
|Lv5  Def-Dwn |        grown so much that they make up big time for it, with Strength, Stamina,
|Lv6  Hush    |	       Agility and Luck receiving big improvements. 
|Lv12 Agi-Up  |	       
|Lv14 Def-Up  |	       Not only that, Spar learns more spells, now being able to heal the party and 
|Lv15 Freeze  |        do some AoE magical damage too, and whips are now a much better weapon type.
|Lv19 Cure 2  |+------------------------+    	   
|Lv20 Heal    || Special Ability: Nature| Spar is a strange mix, but that offers different ways to use the character.

|Nature Ability												     |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|Nature has different effects depending on the terrain it is used (the terrain itself depends on where you're|
|fighting on).												     |
|													     |
|Lakeside: Makes flowers grow on the enemies side of the field. While you could probably think it probably   |
|          does nothing, it actually lowers the Defense of all enemies by aroung 50%!			     |
|Forest  : A tree will jump on the enemies and proceed to hurt them by walking into them. doing around 180   |
|          points of Damage. Can't be resisted.								     |
|Desert  : Some cactus explode, doing around 90 points of damage to all enemies. Can't be resisted either.   |
|													     |
|The rest of the Overworld terrains: It heals the team for 32 hit points.		                     |

	Bleu:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joins at level 39.         Bleu is a secret character you can recruit in this game. A rather obscure one if it 
________		   wasn't for the internet. She also happens to be a goddess and a character from BoFI...
|Spells:\		   
+-------------+		   ...But a lazy and kinda drunk one. Once you find her hidden base, you discover that
|Lv1 S.Boom   |		   she seems to have spent a little too much time drinking and sleeping. 
|Lv1 Bomb     |		   
|Lv1 Flame    | 	   In the original game, she had crazy stats and got the best spells earlier than Nina,
|Lv1 Freeze   |		   making Nina pretty much useless...
|Lv1 Death    |		   
|Lv1 Agi-Down |		   In this hack, taking notice of the fact that she's trying to get back up in shape when
|Lv1 Pwr-Down |		   you find her, she starts with incredibly low stats for her level (I guess that's what
|Lv1 Agi-Up   |     	   she gets for being so lazy). This is also because you can get her very early and having
|Lv1 Def Up   |    	   such a powerful character so soon would be kinda broken.
|Lv1 Atk-Up   |		   
|Lv1 Sap      |		   For the same reason, she learns the most powerful spells at a later levels, and even later
|Lv1 Drain    |		   than Nina. She has many; though.
|Lv1 Exit     |   	   
|Lv1 Warp     |		   But don't worry. While her stats upon joining are very low, her incredible gains are still
|Lv40 Fireball|		   here. From level 39 to level 50 she develops A LOT and catches up the rest of the team.
|Lv41 Hail    |		   
|Lv45 Missile |		   By level 50, compared to Nina, she ends up with less HP and AP, but with slightly higher 
|Lv48 Bolt X  |   	   other stats, making it a bit more fair to the winged lady than before.
+------------------------+ 
| Special Ability: Shed  | If for some reason you end up going beyond level 50, you'll see that she still gets strong
+------------------------+ stat gains. Well, she's a goddess, after all... Even if she starts rusty.
| Bleu recovers all her  | 
| HP and recovers from   |__________________            
| any bad status... But  |Stats at Level 50:\          
| also lowers her Defense+-----------------------------+
| like if she was under  |   HP  AP STR STA AGI WIS LUC|
| the effect of Def-Down.|  265 245 125 160 160 230 165|
| Similar to Guts.       |			       |
+------------------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
|Field ability: BURN EVERYTHING!									     |
| 													     |
| While on a hunting map, Bleu can cast a fire spell, burning up whatever poor thing happens to be on screen.|
| this won't give you great meat, though. You'll get only Charcoal, which has some uses...                   |

5 - Item/Equipment Changes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As far as consumable items, the only changes here are the prices, most of them are lower, as some of them
were a bit too expensive for what they did (like antidotes, or other status healing items.

Smoke bombs also cost less, so they can be used more freely at the beginning of the game.

Fishes are more expensive, but that means you can sell the ones you catch for a bigger profit. The same goes
for the different types of meat, both mechanics make getting money faster while also having to put some effort.

Spells
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Spells in Breath of Fire II are similar to most Dragon Quest games, each spell does a certain amount of damage, with little 
variation (although here it can be reduced with Wisdom, but not to the extent of other RPGs). Healing is similar.

With lower AP costs (For the most part), characters with higher AP, and stronger offensive spells, Magic will probably be 
used more than in the original game. 

Have in mind, though, that spells used by enemies will also have the same power, this will make a few enemies more dangerous.
That and the fact that, the higher the power of a spell, the more damage is reduced with higher Wisdom. Tiny spells like 
Flame that only do ~40 points of damage suffer a lot less from high magic resistance than, let's say, Missile.

So those items with extra Wisdom are more useful latter into the game than early.

* Hail has a special effect, if you push the A button as it's finishing its animation,
  it will continue (Showing ice puppies running around) increasing the final damage of the spell.

** I wanted to make Missile have a lower AP Cost, but because you can get it quite soon for how much damage 
it does thanks to Barose, I had to increase it to a point where it's harder to spam for low level characters.

! Missile and Bolt X don't require a high level of friendship in order to be casted like in the original game.

7 - Useful Gameplay Info
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here I'll write a few things that I personally find useful for people not very used to the game:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· Formations and order are very important, as each formation alters each characters offensive and defensive
  capabilities. Depending on the position, a character will receive a bonus to his/her damage, but also will
  become more susceptible to physical damage and he'll be attacked more often.

  But the game never says how much each formation slot affects. Here's a small list:

  Formation | Slot 1-Slot 2-Slot 3-Slot 4
     Normal | 130%   100%    90%    75%     
    Parallel| 120%   100%    90%    83%
    Scramble| 120%   120%   100%    95%
     Defense| 100%    83%    83%    75%

  This percentages are both the damage the character does AND receives. So a character in slot 4 
  during Normal formation would do 25% less damage, and take 25% less damage.

  Being completely honest, I personally feel that Scramble and Defense are the best two formations.
  Scramble is best if you use more physically oriented characters while Defense offers a better
  protection if you are going to spam spells more often than attacking (or if you want to survive longer).

  I personally don't use Normal or Parallel, and I use Scramble the most because I always end up
  using a good mix of characters, and Scramble doesn't unbalance the damage of your characters unlike
  other formations like Normal, that give a good bonus to the first, but the second and third characters are left behind.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· Condition and Guts are also two stats that are not very clear.

  Condition reflects how a character feels, and it changes the damage a character takes and deals, the higher
  the better, and a poor Condition will make your character weaker. Being cursed lowers the Condition to "Ill".
  
  You can improve a character's Condition by using a "Condition Up" item on them, which can be bought from one
  of the Maniros, or created with the Cook System, and by taking a drink at the bar of your village if you
  chose the arabian builder.

  Guts give a possibility to get back up once a character loses all his/her HP, reviving themselves with a few
  hit points by themselves. the more flames, the more possibilities. It also makes Ryu heal himself more with
  his ability Guts.

· You can actually get Seny a bit early than most people thought.

  Inside the church of Bando (that small peninsula south of Farmland) there were two pressure plates that would
  move a door. During your first visit, if you keep your character on the pressure plate that moves the door to
  the right, and wait for some time (if you emulate the game, use the Fast Forward function if you want), the 
  door will move several times more! 

  Each of these movements hides a room with different things, like some equipment, a few mini-boss battles, 
  some poor people jailed up and also Seny!

Thanks to Capcom for making this game. 
Thanks to Justin3009 for helping me locate spell damage data, I couldn't have found it on my own. Thanks!
Thanks to zanto for developing an Enemy Editor. While at first I hex-edited monsters (as it didn't exist
when I started this hack), this tool was really useful and made my life easier.
